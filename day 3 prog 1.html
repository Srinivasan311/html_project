    <h1>Instruction list/Sequential function chart/Ladder logic</h1>
    <p>Programmable Logic Controller, or PLC, is a digital tool that collects and processes information and directions and executes them for administering machine output.<br>As the name itself suggests, PLC helps in controlling the production.<br>PLC is edited and programmed according to the unique requirements of the user and the result that needs to be produced.<br>PLC software allows machines to perform tasks repeatedly to save time, boost efficiency and diminish errors.</p>

    <h2>instruction list</h2>
    <p>PLC programming has five types of languages â€“ ladder logic, instruction list, structured text, functional block diagram, and sequential flow chart.<br> Each type of PLC language has its own merits and demerits.<br> While some of the languages look good visually and are easy to troubleshoot, other languages have lower memory consumption and faster processing speed.</p>

    <h3>Sequential function</h3>
    <p>he term sequential function chart (SFC) is used for a pictorial representation of a system's operation to show the sequence of events involved in its operation. From: Programmable Logic Controllers (Fifth Edition), 2009.</p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_function_chart#:~:text=Sequential%20function%20chart%20(SFC)%20is,by%20IEC%2061131%2D3%20standard." target="_blank" >click here to know more</a>
    <h4>Ladder logic</h4>
    <p>A ladder logic simulator is a software application that lets you simulate the operation of a PLC ladder diagram with a personal computer, mobile phone or tablet.<br>It allows you to test your PLC ladder diagram without the need to purchase any PLC hardware.<br>A ladder logic simulator also has the ability to control the state of the inputs, outputs and internal variables.<br>This means that input and output devices do not need to be purchased or connected to the PLC.</p>
